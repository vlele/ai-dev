 Delimited by three backticks are requirements for an an information technology asset management (ITAM) system. PLease understand them and wait for me to ask questions.

Please come up with mermaid based model to show the high level subsystems with the ITAM system based requirements included in the three backticks.
Also come up with a domain model with suggested classes using a mermaid diagram
 
```Asset Inventory: The system should be able to maintain a complete inventory of all hardware and software assets owned by an organization. 
 
Asset Tracking: The system should be able to track asset location, status, and usage. This includes information such as who uses the asset, when it was last serviced, and when it is due for replacement. 
 
Asset Lifecycle Management: The system should be able to manage the entire lifecycle of an asset, from procurement to disposal. This includes tracking warranty and lease information, managing asset maintenance and repair, and ensuring compliance with regulations. 
 
Asset Allocation: The system should be able to allocate assets to employees or departments, track usage, and manage reservations for assets that are in high demand. 
 
Asset Reporting: The system should be able to generate reports on asset utilization, availability, and maintenance history. Reports should be customizable and easy to understand. 
 
Integration: The system should be able to integrate with other IT systems, such as procurement, help desk, and financial systems, to ensure consistency and accuracy of data. Security: The system should have robust security features to protect sensitive information about assets, including user authentication, role-based access control, and data encryption. 
 
Scalability: The system should be scalable to accommodate changes in the organization's IT infrastructure, including new hardware and software assets, as well as changes in the number of users and departments. 
 
User-Friendly Interface: The system should have a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate, search, and use. It should also be customizable to meet the needs of individual users and departments. 
 
Accessibility: The system should be accessible from different devices and locations, including mobile devices and remote areas. It should also be accessible to users with disabilities.```
