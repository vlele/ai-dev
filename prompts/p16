Here are some requirements for the software I am building. PLease understand them and wait for me to ask questions.

**ITAM System Requirements**:
Design and implement an ITAM system using ASP.NET Core, C#, and WebAPI that includes the following features:
- **Asset Inventory**: Maintain a comprehensive inventory of all IT assets.
- **Asset Tracking**: Monitor asset location, status, and usage.
- **Asset Lifecycle Management**: Oversee the entire lifecycle from procurement to disposal.
- **Asset Allocation**: Allocate and track assets across employees or departments.
- **Asset Reporting**: Generate customizable reports on asset metrics.
- **Integration**: Ensure seamless integration with other IT systems.
- **Security**: Implement robust security measures to protect asset data.
- **Scalability**: Design the system to easily adapt to changing IT infrastructure.
- **User Interface**: Create a user-friendly and customizable interface.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure system accessibility on various devices and for users with disabilities.


Please come up with a mermaid-based model to show the high-level subsystems with the ITAM system-based requirements included in the three backticks.
Also, come up with a domain model for the asset inventory, including a sampling of classes using a mermaid-based class diagram.

Generate a bicep template for the code above. Make sure you use the cheapest App Service PLan for Linux given that this is all experimental code. 

We have a class called AssetService.Every time we get a new asset added, can you add code to send a message to the Azure Service Bus Topic
