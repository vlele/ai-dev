@workspace DepreciationStrategy and DepreciationRate are not properties of the Asset class. They are part of FundingDetails type. You will need to take that into account 

 FundingDetails = new FundingDetails
               {
                    DepreciationStrategy = depreciationStrategy,
                    DepreciationRate = depreciationRate,
                },



               return new HardwareAssetFactory().New(_nextId++, assetName, assetCost, usefulLife, strategy, depreciationRate, salvageValue, assetPurchaseDate);


                if (assetType == "hardware")
{
    var fundingDetails = new FundingDetails
    {
        DepreciationStrategy = strategy,
        DepreciationRate = depreciationRate,
        Asset = new Asset
        {
            Id = _nextId++,
            Name = assetName,
            Cost = assetCost,
            UsefulLife = usefulLife,
            SalvageValue = salvageValue,
            PurchaseDate = DateTime.Parse(assetPurchaseDate),
        }
    };

    return new HardwareAssetFactory().New(fundingDetails);
}
