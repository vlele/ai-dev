# Please don't offer commentary for the code you generate.
# Define an interface called DepreciationStrategy. 
# It should have four concrete implementations of the interface: StraightLineDepreciationStrategy, DecliningBalanceDepreciationStrategy, DoubleDecliningDepreciationStrategy, and NoDepreciationStrategy.
# Each implementation overrides the calculate_depreciation() method to provide a specific way of calculating depreciation for an asset based on its funding details.
# The calculate_depreciation() method should take a FundingDetails object as a parameter and return a float value representing the depreciation amount.
Add a return statement or throw an not implemented exception so I dont' get the compilatio errors
